Here’s a **single consolidated document** that merges my full review of your original design, critiques, and the new **output-aligned architecture** with improved orchestration and editing flow. You can use it directly as part of your design doc.

# 📄 PRD Agent Architecture – Consolidated Review & Redesign

## 1. Original Challenges Identified

From the initial design, a few issues surfaced:

* **Monolithic Editing**: A single “ChangeWorker” applied patches across the PRD, making it hard to target specific sections and risking unintended side effects.
* **Lack of Output Alignment**: Some subagents (e.g., Context Analyzer, Requirements Extractor) generated insights but didn’t produce PRD-ready text, creating gaps between analysis and the final document.
* **Traceability & Review**: Because intermediate insights weren’t explicitly tied to PRD sections, it was unclear how analysis shaped the final output.

---

## 2. Design Improvements

The redesign shifts toward **output-aligned, modular workers** supported by reusable analyzers, with smarter orchestration.

### 🔑 Key Improvements

1. **Output-Aligned Section Writers**:
   Each PRD section has a dedicated writer (Context, Requirements, Scope, Assumptions, Metrics). These workers produce **PRD-ready text**, not intermediate notes.

2. **Reusable Analyzers as Cognitive Tools**:
   Specialized analyzers (Context Analyzer, Requirements Extractor, Risk Identifier, Summarizer) act as internal helpers. Writers call them when needed, but analyzers do not generate standalone outputs.

3. **Smarter Orchestration**:
   Instead of routing everything through a monolithic patch worker, the Orchestrator **targets specific Section Writers** based on the task. This enables incremental updates and reduces unnecessary rework.

4. **Final Assembly with Validation**:
   Orchestrator merges all PRD sections, applies consistency checks (e.g., requirement IDs, scope alignment), enforces style, and ensures cross-section coherence.

## 3. Target Architecture

### 3.1 Orchestrator

* Accepts tasks: *“Generate full PRD”*, *“Edit Requirements section”*, etc.
* Routes requests to the relevant **Section Writer(s)**.
* Maintains global context, consistency, and style.
* Performs validation during final assembly.

### 3.2 Section Writers (Aligned to PRD Output)

Each writer produces PRD-ready content for one section:

* **Context Writer** → Business/Product Context
* **Requirements Writer** → Functional & Non-Functional Requirements
* **Scope Writer** → In-Scope / Out-of-Scope
* **Assumptions Writer** → Assumptions & Dependencies
* **Metrics Writer** → KPIs, Acceptance Criteria

### 3.3 Analyzers (Reusable Cognitive Workers)

* **Context Analyzer** → Stakeholder goals, market/domain details
* **Requirements Extractor** → Structured requirements from inputs
* **Risk Identifier** → Gaps, conflicts, dependencies
* **Summarizer** → Condenses long source material

> Section Writers consume analyzers’ insights, but analyzers never write PRD text directly.

### 3.4 Patch & Edit Flow

* User requests an edit → Orchestrator routes to the relevant **Section Writer** only.
* Example: Editing “Requirements” → Requirements Writer pulls fresh insights from Requirements Extractor, rewrites the section, updates the PRD.
* Avoids heavy full-document regeneration unless explicitly required.

### 3.5 Final Assembly

* Orchestrator merges outputs into a cohesive PRD.
* Ensures cross-section alignment, consistent formatting, and traceability of sources.

## 4. Benefits of the New Design

* **Output Alignment**: Every worker contributes directly to the PRD.
* **Traceability**: Each PRD section is backed by analyzers’ insights, enabling human review.
* **Reusability**: Analyzers improve once, benefit multiple writers.
* **Granular Editing**: Section-level routing avoids global reprocessing.
* **Scalability**: Adding new PRD sections = adding new writers (reusing analyzers).

---

## 5. Flow Example

1. User uploads kickoff notes + reference docs.
2. Orchestrator → **Context Writer**.

   * Context Writer calls Context Analyzer.
   * Produces PRD-ready *Business Context*.
3. Orchestrator → **Requirements Writer**.

   * Calls Requirements Extractor.
   * Produces *Requirements Section*.
4. Repeat for Scope, Assumptions, Metrics.
5. Orchestrator merges outputs into final PRD.
6. If user requests an edit, only the relevant section is reprocessed.

## 6. Visual Model (Suggested Layout)

```
           ┌─────────────────────────┐
           │       Orchestrator      │
           └──────────┬──────────────┘
                      │
        ┌─────────────┼────────────────┐

┌───────▼───────┐ ┌───▼────────┐ ┌────▼─────────┐

└───────┬───────┘ └───┬────────┘ └────┬─────────┘

        ▼              ▼               ▼
  ┌───────────┐  ┌───────────┐  ┌───────────┐

       ─────> Final Assembly → Validated PRD
```

✅ **Result:** A modular, output-aligned PRD agent where each section is clearly owned, analyzers are reused effectively, and edits are precise, traceable, and easy to maintain.

Would you like me to **polish this into a more formal “design doc style”** (with headings like *Problem Statement, Proposed Solution, Architecture Diagram, Trade-offs, Next Steps*) so it’s presentation-ready for your team?
