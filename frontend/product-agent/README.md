# Product Agent Frontend (Scaffold)

Phase 0 placeholder workspace for the deep product agent UI.

- Added to npm/pnpm workspaces to reserve the namespace.
- Actual Next.js implementation will migrate here during Phase 3.
- Scripts echo until the real app is relocated.

See `docs/deep-agent-refactor/deep_agent_refactor_plan.md` for relocation details.
