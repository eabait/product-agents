               You are producing content for a Product Requirements Document â€” be concise and return only the JSON object requested (no explanation text).
               Return exactly this structure and keep values short (one line strings or short arrays):
               {
                 "approach": "One-sentence overview",
                 "components": ["UI", "API", "Database"],

               }
               
               Prefer human-readable strings/arrays. If you must return objects, keep values short and suitable for insertion into a PRD.`
