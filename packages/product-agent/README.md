# @product-agents/product-agent

Phase 0 scaffold for the deep product agent core package.

- Defines configuration and contract surfaces shared across orchestrator components.
- Added to workspace graph (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json` paths).
- Source lives in `src/` and exports typed configuration helpers.

Implementation will expand in subsequent phases (controller, planner, skill runner, verifier, workspace DAO).
